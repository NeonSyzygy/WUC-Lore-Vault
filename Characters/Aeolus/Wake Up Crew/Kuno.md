The way I originally wrote her a long time ago, something has happened to her that caused her to be what I’m calling [[Soul Locked]]. She is a magic user and had an aura, but can no longer generate mana or project an aura. In the modern version I think I’m going to take this idea more seriously but make it so that her skill still allows her to do magic if she has access to an outside source, which is one of the reasons she and [[Tane Altes]] have constant connections. He is alqays available to top up her magic if need be. I also think it might be interesting to give her some artificial implanted [[Aura Reserve]], but I’m not sure.

One of the benefits of this is that it provides a reason for [[Valen Elicron]] to form an interest in her but not capture her. He would have her as a target to corrupt for [[Chernabog]] since [[WUC]] is looking into the [[Dark Aura]]gic/Dark Aura]] and since all of their members are mages, but when he fondly meets her he would find that she generates no magic of her own. She is useless to [[Chernabog]] if his goal is to siphon as much aura as possible, which means he is free to just hang out with her instead of fighting.
