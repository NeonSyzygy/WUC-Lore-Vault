This simultaneously refers to the intrinsic magical field generated by a [[Mage]] when they [[Channel]] [[Aura]] in order to do [[Magic]], as well as the form and aesthetic that the field takes on when generated.

All things have a [[Dynamic]], but what (usually) separates beings who are capable of doing [[Magic]] from those who are not is the ability for their [[Dynamic]] to [[Siphon]] [[Aura]] from the environment around them. Everything generates [[Aura]], but not in the quantities required to do [[Magic]] at a useful scale proportional to them, and so [[Aura]] must be supplemented from elsewhere. There is a great deal of free [[Aura]] permeating the world, emitted from the larger [[Primordial]]s and other [[Celestials]], and capturing that free [[Aura]] is the most common method for [[Mage]]s to power their [[Magic]].

When doing [[Magic]] this way via [[Siphon]]ing, the [[Mage]]’s [[Dynamic]] acts as a sort of “net,” and the larger it is the more [[Aura]] it can harvest from the world, which can then be used to not only continue to power the [[Dynamic]] itself (making it self sustaining) but also to do powerful [[Magic]]. The size of the [[Dynamic]] is generally restricted by the magical strength of the [[Mage]], both in the sense of how much [[Aura]] they can [[Channel]] as well as how well their physical body can withstand the effects of [[Aura Poisoning]]. The power of magic that can be sustained by a [[Mage]]’s [[Dynamic]] is then limited again by the effects of [[Aura Poisoning]] but also by the harvesting efficiency of their [[Dynamic]]. The more efficient at [[Siphon]]ing your are, the more [[Aura]] you have left over after sustaining your [[Dynamic]], the more powerful [[Magic]] you can perform (assuming you have the physical endurance) at a given [[Dynamic]] size.
