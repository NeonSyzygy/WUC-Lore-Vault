[[Aeolia]] uses a light and mirror based communication system for sending information rapidly between cities (referred to as [[Tower]]s). The capital, [[Keywords/Aeolia/Aeolus]], is powered by natural geothermal power, but the rest of the [[Tower]]s are not, so they must harvest their own heat to run their hydraulics from the sun using massive fields of mirrors that redirect light to a central water tower creating steam power.

In addition to power generation, these massive light collecting systems can use mirrors and lenses to redirect that light toward any of the adjacent [[Tower]]s, and they can interrupt the light using some kind of encoded spinning wheel with blanks and spaces to send blinking codes that can contain information. Every [[Tower]] is within range of at least one other [[Tower]], and every string of [[Tower]]s must be connected at least once to the capital. [[Keywords/Aeolia/Aeolus]] is. It capable of generating/capturing its own light (yet), but it does have a tower and that tower is equipped with mirrors that can redirect any [[Tower]]s beacon toward any other adjacent [[Tower]], enabling relatively rapid bidirectional communication between any two [[Tower]]s in the nation at the speed of light (as long as it is daytime and with a slight delay while the message encoding is read and set up to be relayed).
