The [[Axioms]] are the foundational core rules that keep [[Aeolia]] running the way it does.

The Axioms are:
1. All rules and expectations must be principally symmetrical at all scales and in all cases.
	- *Principally Symmetrical* - The logic of the rules must be applied equally, but the *results* of those rules need not be identical.
	- *At all scales* - Meaning that the expectations of individuals, groups, and governments are all the same. If an expectation exists for an individual, then it exists for the government as well.
	- *In all cases* - The rules apply to everyone, without exception.
2. Those who do not follow the rules are not protected by the rules.
3. One should never expect or demand that others do something that one would not willing do themself.
4. Problems should be solved before they occur.
