This is the phrase used to reference an ongoing collaborative work, codenamed DayDream Company (DDC), that this work is partially derived from.

The Sister Compendium for DDC can be found [Here](https://day-dream-company.github.io/DDC-Canon/).

A snapshot of the Sister Compendium for DDC as it was when the work was split can be found on [The WayBackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20251216144231/https://day-dream-company.github.io/DDC-Canon/). There is no guarantee that the details of any ideas found in either work will remain the same over time, and so it's important to compare against the snapshot in cases of intellectual property ownership.
