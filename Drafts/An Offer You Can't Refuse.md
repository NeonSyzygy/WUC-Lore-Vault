*Tap tap. Swipe, tap. Swipe. Swipe. Tap.*

Aster sits on a stool behind his shop’s front desk, partially reclined against the wall, his feet propped up on one of the shelves under the counter, idly tapping at his crystal interface. A complex diagram of conduit junctions and mana reservoirs slides and zooms around the glass under his fingers. He flicks through multiple pages of networks, focusing manifolds, projectors, and then he scrolls back again. Levels were on the low side of perfect, but still nominal. It would be time for a refitting soon, but not yet. He sighs, blanks out the interface with a wave, and puts it down beside him on the counter with a clack.

“I need a hobby, or a new project…” he said out loud to himself.

One would think that as time moves on and access to Auratech gets more common that there would be more demand for support and maintenance, but there isn’t. The competency of the average person increases and so does the number of people working in the industry, which means less and less work for individual people like Aster. His work for the monarchy was stable and kept him afloat, thanks to his long-term contracts and favorable track record, but it left him with a lot of free time and there were virtually no smaller clients to fill it with. On paper he didn’t mind coasting indefinitely. It was comfortable in comparison to starting from scratch, but it wasn’t exactly fulfilling.

Aster swivels around and leans his elbows on the counter behind him, looking out through the window to the city outside. Buildings cover the mountain's downward terraced slope for miles, before thinning and blending into natural fields far below. He watches people mill about, living their lives under the shadows of the chains that keep Sev'reon's peak tethered, seemingly unconcerned with the gargantuan weight of the infrastructure that protects their lifestyles. Birds dot the sky out beyond the barely visible energy dome, or are they Gryphon carriages destined for distant nations, carrying cargo, or maybe important people? He closes his eyes and tilts his head back, wondering what the rest of the world was like. Of course he had learned the answer, he was well educated, but it isn't the same as knowing. He frequently wondered what his life would be like if he lived somewhere else, if he packed up and moved to a different city, a different nation.

He couldn't do that though. Not right now. His whole life was here. His business is here, his responsibilities are here. His personal investment in this building can't simply be uprooted or easily replicated, and he had spent so long managing the defensive projections of the larger city that there was realistically no one who could replace him. The documentation for the system exists of course. The other engineers would manage in his absence, but if he didn't want to burn the best bridge he had ever built then he would be expected to train a replacement at minimum. That extra workload doesn't sound nearly as comfortable, and he wasn't even sure how to condense almost a decade of practical experience into formal training. Someone would need to shadow him while he works instead of just memorizing schematics and procedures, and that would take years before they could operate effectively on their own. He should have taken an apprentice years ago. He should find an apprentice now because tomorrow could be too late, but technically that would be subcontracting and he'd have to split his income. If his personal ventures were contributing more then he could do it, but things being as they are...

Still, he wondered if there was a version of events that would have been better for him. A choice he could have made differently or a different set of starting conditions that would have seen him take an alternate route through time. More accomplishments, more recognition, more meaningful friends. Any meaningful friends would be good, actually.

“Maybe my trade would be more useful in Aeolus,” he thought. “I’m sure they would value someone who could get them up to speed with modern Auratech, instead of windmills or whatever archaic ‘tech’ it is they still use instead.”

He pondered and wondered for a while longer, until he was pulled from his musings by a notification on his crystalline slate: a customer was approaching the door. He stood up and retrieved his tablet from the counter in one fluid motion, woke the interface with a gesture, and assumed his customer greeting position. The door opened and jostled a set of chimes dangling from the rafters. Aster waited a half a moment for the door to open further, and then looked up from his tablet in mock surprise and interest to greet his guest.

“Hello, and welcome to Veritas Inventa. What can I Repair, Research, or Recharge for you today?” He repeats to yet another stranger.

Aster visually scans the stranger as they enter. They are wearing a white long-sleeved cloak with contrasting embroidery and a hooded capelet over their shoulders. Bright fabrics are fairly common among more affluent citizens, which is consistent with his usual customer base. The capelet is asymmetrical with a longer scarf-like extension crossing the front and hanging over the back of one shoulder, rather than having a part with buttons in the front. Almost certainly a decorative piece, designed to evoke the impression of adventure but ultimately impractical. Again, fitting. A leather strap of some sort runs over their shoulder under their cloak, visible through the hood's opening. Unsurprising. Probably a bag, kept under their cloak to reduce the chance of theft. Random petty crime is uncommon here so close to the plateau, but discerning members of the public tend to be overly cautious. The cloak is buttoned at the chest but falls open above the waist, further suggesting some sort of bag they might want to access semi-frequently. Their pants are more interesting, being made of a much more solid material, slightly roughed up in comparison to their cloak. They suggest someone who actually works for a living, or who doesn't want to worry about replacing their wardrobe very often. The boots tell a similar story. Solid, not flashy, tools more than fashion. This is someone who isn't bothered by having to get their hands dirty, but who wants to be perceived as high-to-medium status. They aren't advertising any possessions of value, but are implying they at least have something worth protecting. Interesting.

Another segment of time passes and Aster sees his customer's face as their hood turns toward him. They appear to be a man, older than himself but not by too much. Straight dark brown hair, layered but otherwise unstyled. Then Aster sees the most interesting clue yet: He wears a set of fairly large circular wire frame glasses, but they don't seem to be corrective lenses since the reflections on the outer surface are flat and undistorted. More than that, though, the reflections are... strange. They are bright? Something about them is wrong, but it's hard to say what. The man's head continues to turn, the glare from the sun moves across the glass as their angle changes, and his eyes are revealed. The glasses must be enchanted in some way, they must be, because this man's eyes have an energy to them that Aster has never seen before. They glow with a literal brightness that can only adequately be explained as the projection of a mage's aura, but people don't usually have an aura projected at all times, do they? It's either the glasses making it visible, or it's a calculated flex by a fairly powerful individual.

Once the man is looking forward and makes eye contact, Aster executes the next step of his business persona. Facets of his tablet reconfigure into a roughly spherical geometric shape in his hand, and he activates another device inside his sleeve. He teleports the sphere out of sight, through the gateway to his pocket dimension formed by the device on his wrist, and then leans forward expectantly resting his hands on the counter in front of him.

The man walks into the room, up to the counter, and simply says "Hello Aster," without breaking eye contact.

Aster sorts through his memory as fast as he can. Does he know this man? He doesn't think he does. His features are kind of plain, but it would be hard to forget the glasses and eyes. Are the glasses new? Is this man a local, or even a citizen of Sev'ren? Seems unlikely, not every element of his wardrobe matches the local fashion. So a foreigner then? Is it possible he crossed paths with this man while traveling? Again, unlikely, Aster doesn't travel almost at all, and never outside Sev'ren's borders. It's possible that he simply knows his name through word of mouth. Maybe he was recommended to come here by another client. Hopefully, but Aster didn't like the tone of his voice.

Having exhausted his mental research, Aster responds "Hi, have I done work for you before?"

"No, you have not," the man says.

A threat, then, Aster thinks to himself. "Excellent," he says with a smile. "Always nice to meet a new customer, what can I do for you?"

"I'm looking for someone who can find some valuable secret information, discreetly. I believe you are the right candidate."

"Magical research is, in fact, one of my services, so you might be right. Do you have any prior work for me to build on, or are we talking about something closer to a rumor?"

"I will provide you an example of what to look for, as well as a target for your investigation. You simply need to find evidence of any similar magical signatures, if they exist, and bring the proof to me."

“If you’re talking about a physical retrieval that complicates things a bit. You’re not giving me the impression this will be easy, or safe. You know that, right?”

“Safety is relative.”

“Then I will need to charge more to contract some people with a more relaxed definition of safety to assist-“

The stranger cut Aster off. “No. Secrecy is paramount. You cannot involve any additional people if you can help it.”

“Then I will still have to bill you as if I were that many people, if you expect me to make a dangerous job that much more dangerous by doing it alone.”

“Of course, name your price.”

Aster went over everything he had learned so far in his head. This person is not particularly interested in providing information freely, but so far he hasn’t been unwilling to answer a question. He considers his responses carefully and only answers the absolute minimum, but that is just because Aster hasn’t asked more pointed questions. “I can’t give you a quote until I know more about the job, and any price we agree on is going to increase after the fact if I encounter any unexpected trouble along the way.”

The man simply maintains eye contact and waits for Aster to continue.

“You said you had an example to show me, what is it?”

“It is a sample of an unknown Aura. Stabilized and entrapped in a mana reserve. Mostly stable, anyway. If you’d like to analyze it directly then I will need to know that you are agreeing to take the job.”

“Yeah, I figured. Where did you get the sample?”

The man pauses for the briefest of moments and his eyes focus on something seemingly deeper into the room before resuming the conversation. The pause was virtually instantaneous, but it was still long enough for Aster to find it disconcerting. "Traces of this unknown aura were found at a small village near the Aeolian border. It isn’t clear what happened, but the event was violent, whatever it was. People are missing. Presumed dead."

A creeping foreboding feeling started to tingle at the back of Aster’s mind. “Dead, as in… murdered? Or some sort of accident?”

”It could be either.”

“This is starting to sound like something that really ought to be handled by the authorities…”

Once again, the stranger simply says nothing.

“And you aren’t here representing The Crown.”

More practiced silence.

Aster mirrors that silence back to the man for a moment, weighing the tension in the air, debating with himself whether he should ask another question. Eventually, he says “You mentioned a target earlier. What is it? You said you already knew where you wanted me to investigate.”

For the first time in the conversation, the man did not answer his question right away. He let the question hang between them, and Aster could feel him trying to pry information from his face before he revealed his answer. Eventually the man said “We believe that Sev’ren is responsible for this attack, as well as other similar events in the region recently. If there is evidence to prove their involvement, we believe it will be here in Sev’reon.”

Aster thought he was prepared for the answer, but the severity of the accusation blows him away. What was at first a tactful dialogue between two calculating individuals was now a crushing wave, and Aster could feel the drowning panic rising within him. "Wait, what?"

Again, silence.

This time Aster is almost grateful for the pause, and uses it to collect his whirlwind of thoughts into a more ordered response. “Putting aside the absolute insane slander against the character of our monarchy, I’ve not heard about these attacks at all. I’m just supposed to take your word for all of this??”

"Well, you wouldn't have heard about them, would you? If Sev'ren were responsible."

"The same can be true if Sev'ren is uninvolved and unaware, or if the whole thing is a lie!"

"Which is why I am asking you to look for evidence one way or another. I would be happy to report Sev'ren's innocence, but first I would actually need to know the truth."

"This is crazy."

"We would pay you well. One year of your current salary for the attempt, another 2 for any evidence."

"That isn't the issue here! And who is 'we' anyway??"

Silence.

"What do you expect me to say to this? What you're asking is borderline treason. You, a stranger, are just going to walk into my shop, ask me to dig through classified national secrets, and use them to incriminate my country?”

"Technically you could say I'm asking you to exonerate your country, but it depends on which outcome you personally think is more likely."

"What are you pretending to be, some sort of international espionage agent?? Why come to me, am I your first choice for this or have you already asked all the shop owners on this terrace and they turned you down?"

"You have uniquely privileged access to sensitive areas as well as a rare skillset which makes you the ideal candidate for this job."

"I have access to the *defensive* hardware, here in the city! What you're talking about is offensive, external. It's a completely different category altogether, and if what you're saying is true it's likely not even official, no one would have access to that information because no one would be dumb enough to put it in writing."

The man shrugs and says "We are working with the tools available to us."

Aster glares back at him. Something about the nonchalant demeanor pissed him off. "Look, even if I were inclined to believe you, and just to be clear, I'm not, you've given me no evidence to build on. Nothing to look for, just some vague hearsay about events without description that might or might not have happened somewhere or other. What am I even supposed to do with that?"

The man reaches into his cloak and retrieves a flat rectangular object. The initial shock of the assertion was wearing off, and Aster was starting to feel better about this interaction now that he was honing back in on his normal collected behavior. The object was similar in size to his own interface, but plain. There were no moving parts. Could it be some sort of magical focus? The stranger holds his object in one hand and begins to lift the other, but then stops and says "I'll show you what to look for, but if I do you won't be able to just walk away. You’d be committing to the job. If you truly want nothing to do with this then just say so, and I'll leave. I'll walk through that door, disappear, and you'll never see me again."

Aster leaned forward on his hands, tapping his fingers slowly, thinking about what he wanted. He looked directly into those faintly glowing eyes for what felt like an eternity, and something else looked back. His curiosity, his desire to prove this person wrong, his sense of responsibility if this person turns out to be right, the opportunity to potentially make life-changing amounts of money, the arrogance to think that no one gets to tell him when it's too late to change his mind, his longing for adventure, all push him bit by bit toward accepting this stranger's ultimatum. He was being challenged. His bluff was being called. Aster had no idea who this person was, but they clearly knew him. Aster sighed and said "Yeah, alright. Fine. Just show me whatever it is." There was no way he wasn't going to open Pandora's Box when it's just sitting right in front of him.

The stranger levels his hand, and with a gesture a crystal appears in the air between them. He is a summoner, then. Aster makes another mental note about the capabilities of his guest and then inspects the crystal. It appeared to be a fairly common facet configuration, roughly cylindrical and twice as long as it is wide, but it was dark. You'd mistake it for obsidian glass if not for its aura. It was not uncommon for magic reservoirs to have their own aura based on their source, but they are almost always contained within the geometry of the crystal. This one escaped the boundary of the gem as if it were emitted from the surface rather than contained within it. The crystal was enveloped by a dark smooth flame. Aster could see why it was magically suspended, rather than handled directly.

"What... is this?" Aster asked, doubt starting to fill his voice.

"That is a great question, isn't it," the man replied.

Aster pulled away from the object and addressed his guest more directly. "You said this was extracted from one of the attack sites. Did they all have traces of this aura?"

”We only found leftover traces at the most recent site.”

"And this aura is what led you to believe Sev'ren was involved?"

"No. Though, you are correct that Sev'ren's rate of magical advancement is plenty of reason to be suspicious of what seems to be new magic. Our reasons for suspecting Sev'ren are circumstantial and irrelevant."

"Irrelevant because they are circumstantial?"

"I'm not going to argue semantics with you."

"Alright, alright." Aster held his hands up in a placative gesture and closed his eyes to think. "What exactly do you know about this… thing... so far?"

"To be honest, not much. As I said, this appears to be entirely new magic. It is highly volatile, difficult to control."

"Magic isn't really 'new,' only new to us. It could just as likely be very old magic."

"You're bordering on semantics again, but yes, you are right. Getting a relatively stable sample using existing techniques was difficult. I captured this sample myself, and I can tell you it doesn't behave like anything I've ever seen."


Aura interrogation and transfer. More specialized forms of summoning. Another piece of information for Aster to file away. The more he talks, the more similar the two of them start to sound. Aster opens his eyes and looks at the sample again. "Has anyone contacted it directly?"

"There were cases where remnants of the magic were found on what we assume used to be bodies, based on the surrounding items."

Aster wasn't sure what he was expecting given that they were talking about terrorism, but that shook him slightly. It also didn’t actually answer his question at all. A deliberate and upsetting non-sequitur. "Has anyone made direct contact *and lived?*"

"Yes."

Aster muttered under his breath "You could have just said that first..."

The stranger simply waited silently for him to process the information and think.

After a few moments and some more anxious finger tapping, Aster lifts his own hand and reaches toward the object. He stops just before touching it and makes eye contact with his new friend, who only stares back wordlessly. He makes no indication that Aster should or should not continue. Aster looks back to the dark flaming crystal, and crosses the remaining inch of distance to touch its surface.

Instantly, Aster is alone in the screaming void. He has no body and yet he can feel himself being pulled in every direction. All he can see around him is the sound of hopeless noise clambering and grasping over stretched skin turned inside out. He can feel the distant horizon careening toward him at the speed of thought, despite the fact that he has none of his own. His aura burns, but without surfaces to cast shadows his light cannot exist. Without gravity his molecules evaporate and his consciousness expands to fill the infinite space. In the blink of an eye Aster Kenos sees his past self become the future Star Void he always wasn't. It would be deeply ironic to him, if his mind had not been manufactured into memories of shrieks inhaled backward until his lungs explode. Particles unwillingly blast through a maze of perpetually branching constricting imaginary vasculature. Endless fragments of himself tear infinite minuscule psychic gouges out of the walls of his soul as they accelerate toward the will of a more powerful being beyond him. His spiritual viscera mixes with a chorus of bleeding voices, twisting against each other fast enough to make their electrons sing. The Aether of uncreation impales him with barbs and drags him inward through himself until the friction from his ragged corpse burns his mana from his veins and there is nothing left.

And then he was back in his shop, with the man in the glasses still standing across the counter.

Aster blinked, and looked at his outstretched hand. He turned it over and dumbly looked at his palm, wondering what to think.

Then, a wave of biological panic hit him. His body was reacting to fear in slow motion, in comparison to what he had just experienced. Adrenaline diffused through his system like a delayed reaction and he felt sweat form, his heart race, his veins constrict, and his body moved. He resummoned his sphere from his pocket dimension to his hand with practiced instinct. Hovering in his hand, unfolded to twice its size, facets linked with delicate hinged pylons, his interface glowed green and warped space. Before the stranger could react or Aster could think, he had activated a network of nodes installed throughout the building which twisted nearby space in front of the counter until time ground nearly to a halt.

Aster's breath caught in his throat as he desperately tried to convince his brain that he wasn't drowning and that he wasn't on fire. He had to remember to breathe, remember to blink, remember to think. The stranger was simply there, stuck with their arm outstretched toward the crystal between them, floating in space with its slow flame barely moving. Aster stumbled back from the counter, trying to think of what the hell he should be doing. This thing scared the shit out of him. The idea that someone just *has* that thing scared him. The idea that someone in Sev'reon might have made that thing scared him. Being associated with that thing scared him. Every option is a bad one, and he can't reasonably trust anyone. Not when so much doubt has been put in his head.

As he ran through possibility after possibility, mentally simulating the outcome of different choices only to have no idea what will happen once that thing gets involved, he realizes that the dark crystal is falling. It's falling slowly, it would take many minutes to reach the counter, but his captive has clearly released his summoning hold on the crystal. He doesn't have infinite time to think, he is going to have to make a choice eventually.

Aster walks back up to the counter, starting to feel a little more normal, and takes in the situation. The man has released the gem, and his eyes are firmly locked on it. His face has a much more serious look of determination on it, and Aster can't blame him. He continues looking for information and spots something curious. A rogue patch of light is ever so slowly inching across the floor between the stranger and the window. It takes Aster a second to do the math, but eventually he traces the reflection back to the rectangular object in the man's hand. He is holding a mirror, and he is slowly, almost imperceptibly rotating its reflective side away from himself. Interesting.

Waiting to actually see what his captive is trying to do does not sound like a great idea, and he does not have the mana reserves to pull this trick forever, so he thinks to himself that time is up. Time to make a choice. He looks at the gem, steels himself, and reaches for the terrifying artifact a second time. This time he doesn't intend to touch it. This time he means to contain it in his pocket dimension, where it will hopefully be safe. He reaches out toward the crystal, feeling the spacetime gradient resist his movement as his hand gets closer, until suddenly he hits a wall.

His fingers collide with a white frosted translucent surface between him and the crystal. What? Aster quickly looks up to the stranger, only to find the stranger's own burning eyes looking directly back at him. Aster looks back and forth once between the force field and the stranger, retrieves his hand, forms a fist, and dumps as much energy into his hand as he can to increase its mass as he tries to punch through the surface.

His fist crashes into the force field, a spiderweb of fractures propagate across it just barely slow enough to be tracked by the human eye. The pain receptors in his metacarpals roar despite the extra structural inertia, and the surface remains effectively solid. He looks at the man and swears he sees a hint of a raised eyebrow. Curiosity? Surprise? Mockery? Looking back to the surface Aster watches as the force field slowly cracks and shatters in reverse, gradually healing itself back to its soft translucent finish.

He could hit it again, but even ignoring its regeneration it isn't clear to him that he would break through before he breaks his hand, and that's to say nothing about the stranger simply creating another, and another. Aster lowers his arm and backs away, only to bump into yet another wall. Without taking his eyes off of the stranger's, he feels along the new wall behind him with his free bruised hand. He doesn’t manage to find an edge. Only more surface extending out further than he can reach, preventing escape.

A new type of slow panic starts to seep in. As he starts to wonder if he regrets his choices, a voice fills his mind. The voice of the stranger, slow and distorted, says inside him "I warned you. You cannot back out now."

As Aster starts to lose his composure he blindly asks "What are you...?"

The voice in his head responds "A patient man."

Somehow, that does not comfort Aster even slightly. He is way out of his depth. Whoever this person is, he is clearly in control of some seriously specialized and advanced magic techniques. Thought projection is something Aster had theorized he could accomplish, but projecting any form of direct summoning across empty space has been a struggle without dedicated hardware repeaters. This guy can transfer his thoughts across empty space through force of will alone, and he can do it while evoking... whatever these things are. Direct manifestations? They don't look like alchemy, they must be raw aura. It's astounding that his thoughts are intelligible as language at all at this extreme of a time gradient. His reaction speed is easily orders of magnitude faster than normal, and without the need to move his body he is barely at a disadvantage even while stuck in the warp bubble. This guy's brain is on a completely different level.

While Aster wastes precious seconds thinking and worrying, the stranger's eyes have switched targets. Aster feels the interaction of two different mana streams before anything else. His attention snaps to his crystalline interface hovering above his palm. He can feel the strange soft magic suffusing around his own aura, trying to lock in on his device. Aster can intuit what is about to happen. The stranger is going to teleport his interface right out of his hand, he will lose control over his aura network, the flow of local time will return to normal, and then any number of terrible things will happen to him.

Aster's heart sinks.

He has exactly one trick left, but he knows it’s pointless. He pours even more of his own aura directly into his interface, increasing its energy density to the point where it would cost an equally unreasonable amount of mana to move it. He looks at the stranger again to find that he has moved the mirror even further. Its reflective surface faces the ceiling, and his hand is half outstretched toward the dark crystal, as if he means to catch it. The reflection in the mirror, however, is not of the ceiling. It’s somewhere altogether different, outdoors, facing downwards. So not a mirror, but a portal. The man's eyes are still lingering on the heavy interface locked in space from impossible inertia, but as Aster watches he sees them flick in slow motion to meet his own.

The voice speaks again. "You won't last long."

Aster can feel the tips of his fingers burning. Mana poisoning. The man is right. Of course he is. What was Aster thinking, this whole charade was a mistake from the get-go. He should have walked away. At this point he has three options: Get killed and buried in a ditch by a foreign national for who knows what reason, get killed by his own country for knowing too much, or die from mana poisoning trying to fight the magical equivalent of an elephant with his bare hands. The first and last options are technically the same, he muses to himself.

He shouldn't have wished to live in more interesting times.

With the resolve of someone who has nothing left to lose, Aster redoubles his efforts and metaphysically reaches out through his floating interface, across his shop's network, toward the falling crystal. If he can just get the crystal into his pocket dimension this will be over. Once he has control of it then no one else can use it. If this man wants it back then he'll have no choice but to leave Aster alive. The crystal is within the outer edge of the projected gravity field slowing the stranger, effectively making it beyond the range he can normally reach with his network, but he has to try. If this guy can summon at range with the worst handicap of all time then, damn it, so can Aster. His interface glows green, then white. Necrotic tendrils of dying veins creep up his neck under his skin as he pushes his summoning magic out. From his perspective the room contracts under the negative gravity of his aura, the falling flaming gem tantalizingly close.

In the far distance of the recent past, chimes jingle.

The voice in his head simply says "Saved by the bell."

The force fields disappear. The suffocating pressure of a forced teleport vanishes from around the spherical construct. Aster Exhales a mental gasp and releases his magic before it kills him. Time catches up with the present and Aster's interface alerts him to someone approaching the door. The flaming crystal falls. The mirror flashes. The door is already open. The crystal vanishes through the mirror. A new figure crosses the threshold. Aster's interface collapses into his palm, and the ominous stranger returns the mirror to a pocket beneath his cloak.

The first stranger acknowledges the second, then turns to Aster and simply says "I'll be in touch," before calmly exiting the building.

The newcomer watches him leave and then turns to Aster. He is wearing a black leather duster jacket and appears to be closer to Aster's own age. Beyond that Aster can't bother to observe anymore. He asks Aster, "What was that about, are you ok?"

Aster pockets his interface, shakes out his still sore fist, and unconvincingly says with a shaky voice "Yeah... I hope so."

[[Aster Kenos]] is at his shop, bored, when someone comes to his door. This person is [[Tane Altes]], and he is here to convince [[Aster Kenos]] to engage in illegal espionage about events that [[Aeolia]] believes [[Sev’ren]] is responsible for. [[Tane Altes]] is skeptical that [[Aster Kenos]] will agree and fully expects to have to take extreme action to keep his presence in the city secret, but also agrees that [[Aster Kenos]] is the ideal candidate because for this job. He has the skill and the access to do it cleanly. [[Aster Kenos]] catches on sort of slowly because [[Tane Altes]] leads him on gently, but ultimately [[Aster Kenos]] understands the severity of what [[Tane Altes]] wants and turns on him. [[Tane Altes]] tempts [[Aster Kenos]] one last time with an offer of some kind of intellectual and magical curiosity in exchange, and also tells him that the goal is not to destabilize his country, but rather to absolve it. He claims that Aster has the opportunity to potentially stop a war before it starts. He and [[Tane Altes]] have a “fight” in mental wizard chess kind of way, where the focal point of the fight is [[Aster Kenos]] putting [[Tane Altes]] in a strong gravitational field reducing the speed of time around him, and [[Tane Altes]] is able to fight back by manifesting his forcefields with his hyper accelerated mind despite his body being slowed down. The stress of sustaining the warp field is not something [[Aster Kenos]] can do for more than a minute or two and [[Tane Altes]] basically waits him out. They finish the fight with a sort of respect for each other, but are still wary. Ultimately [[Aster Kenos]] agrees, triggering the horrifying vision that triggers the fight, but it is ultimately interrupted by [[Daz]] showing up.

# Notes
## [[Tane's Glasses]]
I like the idea that [[Tane's Glasses]] have been enchanted to have a direct connection to his brain via [[Summoning]] magic and that they could serve as inspiration here for [[Aster Kenos]] to potentially work with [[Tane Altes]] to build a similar high speed interface for [[Aster Kenos]] to replace his physical collapsible orb.
## Aster's Stasis Field
My initial justification/description of Aster's magic is that he's using gravity, or energy density, to create warped spacetime that results in the slower passage of time, but I want to revisit this and make sure the physics are actually even remotely possible. If not, then I might switch his magic to be raw time manipulation using [[Summoning]] and [[Augmentation]].

After doing some math on some online calculators, it seems like getting a 10:1 time factor using a mass that is 3ft and 10 feet from the two positions would require something like 100 times the mass of earth, which is... nonsense lol. This might not be possible the way I'm imagining it. I was also considering avoiding part of this issue by claiming that he was simply condensing [[Aura]] itself as a form of energy to slow time, because all energy contributes to time dilation, not just mass. The issue is that all energy contributes to *gravity* as well, so this actually changes nothing. I may need to switch him to direct time control in order for this to work in way that doesn't fuck everything up.

If I change him, then I think I'm changing him to [[Summoning]]: Dimensional warping, and [[Augmentation]]: Fundamental forces. I would keep the same limitations f distance, and I would keep the same micro black hole network exploit to overcome it, but the magic he is working over that network would be raw time control, not necessarily gravity.
