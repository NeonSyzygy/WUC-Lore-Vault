# Summary
[[Rena]] goes to recover the [[Crystal Sword]] for herself, and meets [[Kuno]] who is it's current owner. They fight over it, and ultimately [[Kuno]] wins, or at least she would have killed [[Rena]] if not for [[Rena's Amulet]]. [[Kuno]] realizes what [[Rena's Amulet]] does, and in a moment of compassion [[Rena]] allows her to try to get it to draw from [[Kuno]]'s [[Aura]]. It doesn't work, and [[Kuno]] looses a significant chunk of resolve, simply giving up the sword. [[Rena]] offers her a place in [[WUC]], hoping that maybe as a group they can figure out a way to help her recover her magic.

# How Do They Know [[Kuno]]'s Location
On one hand, I think [[Kuno]] sort of wants to be found. She wants to fight people, she wants to push the [[Crystal Sword]] to do something or she wants to die and be done.
On the other, [[Kuno]] will have gone to the same place she and [[Valen Elicron]] go in [[Eyes Of A Dragon]] because that is one of the places she goes when she wants to escape from the world.
# Sword Choreography
## [[Kuno]]’s Stance
[This video](https://youtu.be/DvfbHe_xnVM?t=86) shows as close an example to [[Kuno]]'s counterattack. In the video they go for a sliding stab along the opponent's blade keeping them on the outside, but in the demo the first attacker just stands there and does nothing. In [[Rena]]'s case she would need to rotate her guard and lift up with the back edge of the blade.

## [[Rena]]’s Stance
I think I’m imagining [[Rena]] starting with the Archer’s Guard (shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/ibWNxM9Q7Ro?si=DophfoYtn0Wr5Q6h)). The
Is guard more definitely uses 2 hands though, and I’m not sure how hard I want her to commit to using a one handed strategy. It kinda doesn’t make a lot of sense to use one hand without a good reason, and you can always let go with one if you need to.
# An evolution of the amulet test
The plan has always been for kuno to win, the amulet saves Rena, kuno sees what happened and grabs the amulet hoping to get it to draw out her own aura by force, but it doesn’t work and she just cuts herself or something. Then she drops the sword and gives up, utterly defeated and hopeless that she will never be magical again.

I had a thought recently that Reba might respond to this failure by sort of trying to combine their aura, or to sort of share the channeling load, and that it *kinda works,* at least enough to give kuno hope. Then Tane comes in and basically says we can help you, helping mages develop their powers is what they do.
