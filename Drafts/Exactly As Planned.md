# Overview
This is a directly parallel version of [[An Offer You Can't Refuse]] from the perspective of [[WUC]]. [[Rena]] and [[Sebastian]] are in some sort of nearby building (probably somewhere one could sit by a window with food, where adventures might be commonly seen), [[Tane Altes]] is entering [[Veritas Inventa]] to speak with [[Aster Kenos]], and [[Kuno]] and [[WUC Archer]] are outside the magic dome with the [[Dark Aura]] [[Aura Reserve]].

The plan is to teleport the crystal in and out via the mirrors to prevent city security from being able to detect it, and for [[Rena]] and [[Sebastian]] to provide backup as a last resort in case [[Tane Altes]] somehow needs help. [[Kuno]] and [[WUC Archer]] are on crystal duty because [[Kuno]] is [[Soul Locked]] and [[WUC Archer]] is not a mage, so they are least e[[Dark Aura]]e [[Dark Aura]].

Something does go slightly wrong: [[Tane Altes]] loses his thought projection link with [[WUC]] when [[Aster Kenos]] gravity traps him, and [[Daz]] shows up with [[Jawaku]] which would make a fight a terrible idea. other than that, the mission goes smoothly. Nothing that [[Tane Altes]] couldn’t handle on his own, and since the mirrors are more of a permanent enchantment they were never interrupted.

## Sebastian's Food
- A stack of items that are a combination of funnel cake and waffles.
