From the second Daz opened the door to [[Veritas Inventa]], he could feel that something was wrong. It was the sound of the welcome chimes. He had come here often enough in the past to know how Aster’s doorbells sounded, but this time there was a difference. It was like they had a echo to them, as if the size of the room were larger than he knew it actually was. It was a change subtle enough that at first he was not even fully conscious of what he was sensing, only that he couldn’t help but feel uneasy.
# (For reference)
In the far distance of the recent past, chimes jingle.

The voice in his head simply says "Saved by the bell."

The force fields disappear. The suffocating pressure of a forced teleport vanishes from around the spherical construct. Aster Exhales a mental gasp and releases his magic before it kills him. Time catches up with the present and Aster's interface alerts him to someone approaching the door. The flaming crystal falls. The mirror flashes. The door is already open. The crystal vanishes through the mirror. A new figure crosses the threshold. Aster's interface collapses into his palm, and the ominous stranger returns the mirror to a pocket beneath his cloak.

The first stranger acknowledges the second, then turns to Aster and simply says "I'll be in touch," before calmly exiting the building.

The newcomer watches him leave and then turns to Aster. He is wearing a black leather duster jacket and appears to be closer to Aster's own age. Beyond that Aster can't bother to observe anymore. He asks Aster, "What was that about, are you ok?"

Aster pockets his interface, shakes out his still sore fist, and unconvincingly says with a shaky voice "Yeah... I hope so."
