# Overview
Basically the Fold leaders are upset about the magic users amassing magic tools to make them even stronger, they want to control and be able to deny access to them, and [[WUC]] is arguing that they are the only people who can even use them and that they empower them to serve [[Aeolia]]. At some point the manifold members devolve into incoherent arguing and [[Tane Altes]], having had enough of this, uses his magic and his accelerated mind to bombard their minds with a telepathic “shut up and give me your attention” the room is stunned, and he removes his glasses and speaks to them as close to a normal person as he can be. When he joined [[WUC]] he promised not to abuse his power and to do what is good for [[Aeolia]]. That does *not* mean he needs to refrain from using his power to correct behavior and actions if citizens, even high status ones, if that behavior is harmful to the nation. The many over all. He also explains that some of these artifacts are literally made *by* people like he and his sister, and that this is the exact kind of thing that causes the two of them to leave the nation and why she has yet to return. This kind of overbearing fearful mistrust will only force the magic users to develop on their own, rather than be educated of the responsibility they hold, which was the entire point of this new fold.
