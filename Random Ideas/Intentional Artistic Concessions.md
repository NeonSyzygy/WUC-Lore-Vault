# Light Changes Intensity as Time Changes
When there is a time gradient, the faster moving area appears brighter from inside the slowed area, because the faster area is still producing the same number of photons as before, so the photon flux entering the slow region would be higher. I want people to be able to still see normally, which means photons must change energy based on the flow of time. As they enter a 1/10th speed zone, they would need to be 1/10th the energy.
