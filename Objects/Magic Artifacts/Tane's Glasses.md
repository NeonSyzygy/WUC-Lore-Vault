[[Tane Altes]] has an enchanted pair of glasses that accelerates the wearer's cognition so that they perceive the world in slow motion when they want to.

The glasses are non-corrective lenses made from [[Dragon Glass]], and they have an augmentation enchantment imbued into them that accelerates the mental perception of the person wearing them. Wearing these glasses effectively gives you “true sight” and allows you to see the world in slow motion.
# Creation
The glasses were enchanted by [[Tane's Sister]], as her primary form of magic is [[Augmentation]].

I do not know where the lenses themselves were made, but I am thinking about having them be made at the same time as the [[Crystal Sword]]. One version of events might be:
- [[Tane's Sister]] has found a small amount of [[Dragon Glass]].
- She has plans for the glasses.
- She finds a blacksmith who can make them for her.
- The smiths ask where she was able to get the material, as getting more would allow them to finish a long term job for some rich person.
- She and the rest of the [[Doomed Adventurers]] agree to track down the lead and find more of it in exchange for payment.
- They fight the dragon.
- They return with the [[Dragon Glass]] and [[Rena]] commissions the [[Crystal Sword]].

At some point the glasses are given to [[Tane Altes]], and he keeps them from then on.
