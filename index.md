# Origin of Ideas & Acknowledgements
The characters, narrative, world, mechanics, and ideas presented here are one step in a long history of collaborative and constantly changing storytelling that I'm grateful to have been a part of. I was invited into a shared fictional world ([[DDC]]), and in addition to adapting my own prior writings to fit into that narrative I also contributed new ideas to flesh out the world and its mechanics. As time went on and the world evolved to meet the needs of my friends, it started to diverge from the image I had built for myself in my head. I love that shared world, but I also love the ideas and systems I invented that no longer fit into that world, and so I have decided to isolate them and build on them here where they can exist without compromise.

Nothing here is meant to revoke anyone's ability to use these concepts where they have already been given. Where these, or similar, concepts have already been contributed, they can continue to be used and be expanded upon. By the same turn, I do not intend to reproduce or copy other elements from the prior shared work that were created by others, but in some instances it my not be possible to fully detangle one person's creativity from another's. For the sake of transparency, I will be listing here ideas that I will not be using because they belong to others, ideas that I believe are fully mine, and ideas that I acknowledge are not fully mine but that I believe are either integral to the work or that I believe are transformed enough to be distinct from their original form.

This list is not exhaustive, and will be updated over time as needed. If I discover anything I failed to address, or if I receive permission to include something that does not belong to me, I will add it to the list. Beyond that, I intend that anything I add to this compendium that does not make an appearance on this list is original work of my own.
## Relinquished Ideas
## Shared Ideas
### Aura/Dynamic
These two terms are sometimes used synonymously in [[DDC]] and other times they are merely related.

A mage's Dynamic is always referring to the effect that envelops their body when they work magic. It is synonymous with the actual English word "Aura."

Aura sometimes refers to the same thing as Dynamic, a person's literal Aura, but more technically it refers to the "fuel" expended to produce magic effects. It is better understood to mean the same thing as "Mana," rather than what the word "Aura" normally means, even if people in the world of [[DDC]] will colloquially use it that way.
### Magic "Quadrants"
In [[DDC]], magic was split into four "Quadrants" for the purposes of controlling and limiting how much magic a single character could have.

The quadrants were:
- Alchemy - Typically some sort of transmutation or creation of a real material.
- Augmentation (previously "Boost")- Any effect that modifies the "traits" or "stats" of a thing.
- Manifestation - A more narrow effect that make's a mage's Aura or Dynamic "real" and tangible.
- Summoning - Moving or teleporting something.

Initially the rules was that no character could have access to more than 2 quadrants. Over time this rule softened and shifted so that it were possible to learn effects from more than 2, but that any time spent mastering one meant that you will not be as proficient in another. Then, it changed again to be that there are virtually no restriction on what effects can be learned, but that instead the restriction prevents you from having more than 2 types of magic *active* at once.

The nature of the idea itself is constantly in flux in the first place, and I contributed to the idea at every stage beyond it's very first form. I plan to utilize the idea of *some kind* of division between types of magic, and to include *some kind* of mechanical restriction on which/how many kinds a single person can use, but I intend to modify the names, the nature, and potentially the number or "quadrants."
