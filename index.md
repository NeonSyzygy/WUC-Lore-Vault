# Origin of Ideas & Acknowledgements
The characters, narrative, world, mechanics, and ideas presented here are one step in a long history of collaborative and constantly changing storytelling that I'm grateful to have been a part of. I was invited into a shared fictional world ([[DDC]]), and in addition to adapting my own prior writings to fit into that narrative I also contributed new ideas to flesh out the world and its mechanics. As time went on and the world evolved to meet the needs of my friends, it started to diverge from the image I had built for myself in my head. I love that shared world, but I also love the ideas and systems I invented that no longer fit into that world, and so I have decided to isolate them and build on them here where they can exist without compromise.

Nothing here is meant to revoke anyone's ability to use these concepts where they have already been given. Where these, or similar, concepts have already been contributed, they can continue to be used and be expanded upon. By the same turn, I do not intend to reproduce or copy other elements from the prior shared work that were created by others, but in some instances it my not be possible to fully detangle one person's creativity from another's. For the sake of transparency, I will be listing here ideas that I will not be using because they belong to others, ideas that I believe are fully mine, and ideas that I acknowledge are not fully mine but that I believe are either integral to the work or that I believe are transformed enough to be distinct from their original form.

This list is not exhaustive, and will be updated over time as needed. If I discover anything I failed to address, or if I receive permission to include something in my work that does not belong to me, I will add it to the list. Beyond that, I intend that anything I add to this compendium (Starting from [12/12/2025](https://web.archive.org/web/20251212113156/https://neonsyzygy.github.io/WUC-Canon/)) that does not make an appearance on this list is original work of my own.
## Relinquished Ideas
### Characters
Individual characters are by far the largest list of ideas to cover, and specifically describing each and every character's traits and planned story in writing is so large a task that, frankly, it hasn't even been done in the first place, let alone a second time here. I will instead simply list the names of the characters, and encourage you check out their entries in [[DDC]] if you are curious about them.

### The Swalescape
The Swalescape is a living swamp ecosystem that migrates across the world.
### The Country of Sev'ren and its Capital, Sev'reon
Sev'ren is a highly magically advanced nation, but its defining feature is its capital. Sev'reon is built directly on the slopes of a mountain. The mountain's peak has been fractured and removed, and a massive crystal at the center of the mountain's peak keeps the massive piece of earth floating above the city. The mountain's peak is tethered with huge chains or cables to keep it in place, and the entire city is protected inside a spherical dome or projected magical force. Other notable features are that the nation is a monarchy, and that gryphon riders make up part of the nation's military.
### Neamhríocht, or the Sky Kingdom
The Sky Kingdom is a location up in the clouds where magic is strong and chaotic, and it's inhabited by dangerous and otherworldly creatures.
### The Memory Loss Event
This is an event that predates my involvement and was in the origional first chapter manuscript that I read. It could be argued that it was formative in setting the events of DDC in motion, but it exclusively involves characters that are not mine, and so I have no intention of keeping it.
### Infinite Magic Transformation
While I think this concept is not only intentionally derivative, but also was simply never actually fleshed out in the first place, I am not convinced it has a place in my world. I could make the argument that it should be a shared idea both because I helped work on it and because the idea of a transcendent and powerful state achieved by focus and harmony is found all throughout fiction, but I will not. I hope to see this concept built into something awesome in its own world.
### The Phoenix Cult
In [[DDC]], one of the Phoenixes had its ability to Emulate taken from it, and instead it must be bound to a mortal vessel, kept alive, and transitioned when that vessel expires. To service this process, a bunch of worshipers of the Phoenix formed a temple to oversee this process, and this group eventually devolved into a sort of religious cult.

This is far too specific and far too cool for me to take.
## Shared Ideas
### Aura/Dynamic
These two terms are sometimes used synonymously in [[DDC]] and other times they are merely related.

A mage's Dynamic is always referring to the effect that envelops their body when they work magic. It is synonymous with the actual English word "Aura."

Aura sometimes refers to the same thing as Dynamic, a person's literal Aura, but more technically it refers to the "fuel" expended to produce magic effects. It is better understood to mean the same thing as "Mana," rather than what the word "Aura" normally means, even if people in the world of [[DDC]] will colloquially use it that way.
### Magic "Quadrants"
In [[DDC]], magic was split into four "Quadrants" for the purposes of controlling and limiting how much magic a single character could have.

The quadrants were:
- Alchemy - Typically some sort of transmutation or creation of a real material.
- Augmentation (previously "Boost")- Any effect that modifies the "traits" or "stats" of a thing.
- Manifestation - A more narrow effect that make's a mage's Aura or Dynamic "real" and tangible.
- Summoning - Moving or teleporting something.

Initially the rules was that no character could have access to more than 2 quadrants. Over time this rule softened and shifted so that it were possible to learn effects from more than 2, but that any time spent mastering one meant that you will not be as proficient in another. Then, it changed again to be that there are virtually no restriction on what effects can be learned, but that instead the restriction prevents you from having more than 2 types of magic *active* at once.

The nature of the idea itself is constantly in flux in the first place, and I contributed to the idea at every stage other than it's very first form. I plan to utilize the idea of *some kind* of division between types of magic, and to include *some kind* of mechanical restriction on which/how many kinds a single person can use, but I intend to modify the names, the nature, and potentially the number or "quadrants."
### Sev'reon's Magic School
Sev'reon had a mage college where [[Aster Kenos]], Akela Kalani, and Sev'erna (along with some of her retainers) studied at the same time. The nature of the school was never fully defined, partially because the school did not necessarily have a set curriculum. It was imagined as a prestigious place where mages could get highly tailored education that suited their unique dynamics, as well as providing more stereotypical and complete magical education should a student not want to hyperspecialize.

I reserve the right to have a college for mages, as have many magical fantasy worlds before. My own characters [[Aster Kenos]] and his college mentor [[Lyssa Vrendel]] have almost all of their interactions in the school, and so I will need a place for that to happen. I think that by removing the school from its location in Sev'reon I will have removed most, if not all, of its prior characterization that would have actually made it unique compared to other schools found in fiction.
### "The Underdark"
I shouldn't have to explain this one. The name was obviously placeholder, we just never got around to naming it something unique.

We wanted a deep underground system of caverns and tunnels that span the continent with an entire collection of ecosystems of its own, and we simply referred to it as "The Underdark" because it was the simplest way to explain the vibe we wanted. I reserve the right to have an underground region in the same way that we did in DDC, by drawing inspiration from existing media with the intent to create a unique and transformative, but still potentially derivative, work.
### The In-Universe Trading Card Game
The idea that this world should have its own fantasy equivilent of Magic The Gathering (or Pokemon, or any other TCG you can think of) was a collaborative running joke that we started to take seriously. The idea that a world would have entertainment is not exactly groundbreaking, but what is actually unique are the game systems and rules that I, and I alone, worked on. The development on a *playable version* if the in universe game is mine, and I intend to continue developing my game rules into a full game.
### Orichalcum
This, alongside crystals, was one of the more magically conductive materials in the world. Given that this is literally just a real world metal with pre-existing legends, I reserve the right to use this in the same way that [[DDC]] took an existing idea and tried to make it unique.
### Wire-Men
Once again, this is a concept borrowed from prior media, but visually tweaked slightly and given its own name. These enemies made of [[Dark Aura]] are functionally identical to any other shadowy identical hoard of enemies like [The Heartless in Kingdom Hearts](https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Heartless). I reserve the right to take inspiration in the same way to make unique transformative ideas.
### "Humanoids"
The idea that there should be a collective term or idea for "people" who are members of societies but who are of varying fantasy races seems obvious to me. In [[DDC]] we never really settled on a name, so "Humanoids" was as far as we got. I will be using this concept, though with a different name and hopefully different comprising sentient races.
### Fantasy Races and Creature Types
[[DDC]] expanded to include literally any fantasy creature or humanoid you could think of. Elves, Dragons, Vampires, etc. I will obviously use these concepts if I feel like it because they are so generic you'll almost certainly end up using one without even realizing.

The reason I bother to mention it here is because some of them, Vampires in particular, have gotten more unique development in [[DDC]] than others. I do not want to copy or use the same versions of these creature types as are in [[DDC]]. I don't want them to work the same as they do in typical fiction either. I want my creatures to be inarguably distinct. So, while I reserve the right to use these concepts, I have no intention of making them similar to the versions found in [[DDC]].
### Tournament Arc
This one is connected to a lot of ideas I do *not* want to use, but I like one element of it.

Some members of [[DDC]] wanted a "Tournament Arc" in the narrative, and in brainstorming how that could happen I came up with the idea for an Olympics style event hosted by different countries, where the competitions are all magical in some way, and where each nation sends their strongest mages to compete. The rough idea was that a villainous nation would host the games and then execute some scheme to trap or kidnap all of the best fighters for some reason or another.

Specifically the idea of a villain hijacking an existing international competition event is the thing I'm claiming to have come up with, and that I might like to use. The details of who does what and what the games actually are are all irrelevant, and I will be ensuring that those details are unique if I do use this idea.
### Phoenix
[[DDC]] had a relatively unique interpretation of what the Phoenixes were, and they called the ability to be reborn after death the ability to Emulate, which I love. I reserve the right to have phoenixes in my world as they are traditional mythical creatures, but I do not intend to copy them as they are in [[DDC]] and I will not be using the term Emulate in their context. That is far too cool a name for rebirth, and it should be allowed to shine in [[DDC]] where it belongs.
### Great Spirits and Aspects
These are members of the "larger than mortals" set of beings that go all the way up to the size of the [[Primordial]]s. While I claim the specific interpretation of the beings in [[The Age of Primordials]] as completely my own, the *concept of Great Spirits* itself is clearly a shared idea. The exact nature of how a Greater Spirit is an "aspect" will differ between [[DDC]] and my work, but the base premise comes from shared DNA. At minimum I plan to have a different pantheon of Aspects, on top of the changes to magic and spirits I've detailed elsewhere.
## Original Ideas
### [[Magic]]
My version of magic has ended up being very different from how magic started in [[DDC]]. Before me, magic in [[DDC]] was something that came *from people.* It was a thing you either had or you didn't, and if you spent it faster than you could regenerate it then it damaged you. Your Aura (later Dynamic) was more like a *thing* than an effect, almost like a soul. What I came up with ended up being completely different, and different in a way that stopped being compatible with what other members wanted for the world.

In my version of [[Magic]], [[Aura]] is produced by all things, and all things have a [[Dynamic]]. The relative size and strength of magic that a thing can perform on its own is proportional to it's own size, and the ratio is small. In order for a being to do magic they would need to *capture and channel* excess [[Aura]] that is shed by larger beings, such as the [[Primordial]]s. Then, because magic is about channeling, the [[Aura Poisoning]] that comes from pushing too hard is instead a function of channeled [[Aura]] per second vs how strong you are.

There are more differences, but I will simply leave the detailed description in the [[Magic]] page, rather than duplicating the whole thing here.
### [[Metal Glass]], or Dragon Glass
This is an original idea of mine that partially predates my involvement with [[DDC]] at all. The main two distinctive features of [[Metal Glass]] glass are:
1. That it is a material that experiences a “phase change” between metallic and crystalline forms when its metal form is heated beyond a certain point.
2. Looking through its crystal form reveals hidden or invisible magical things.

It is possible that the phase transition is something I came up with while working on [[DDC]], but even if that is true I am confident this is entirely my creation.

It’s also worth mentioning that the origin of the name “Dragon Glass” comes from the idea that if you find [[Metal Glass]] in its crystal form, then it’s likely that a Dragon has made its home there, because the heat of a Dragon’s flame breath can cause the naturally forming metal form to phase shift. Also, dragons probably like it because it’s more magically attuned as a material.
### [[Aeolia]] and [[Aeolus]]
These are a nation, and its capital (The names are subject to change), that are located in a part of the world that has been *non-magical* for generations, and is only slowly starting to produce mages again as the results of the [[Great Disaster]] have slowly faded. This nation, and all of the characters and ideas that are contained within, are solely my work.

Relevant ideas include:
- The [[TRS]] and its [[Tower]]s
- [[Manifold]]s, [[Fold]]s, and the [[Guild Council]]
- [[Merit]]
- Various types of [[Steam Tech]]
### The [[Pre-Aeolus]] Nation, the [[Anti-Magic Weapon]], the [[Great Disaster]], and the [[Dark Aura]]
All of these related concepts are missing final names. They will be updated as I refine what to call them, but conceptually I do not expect them to change much.

The [[Great Disaster]] is a specific narrative event that befalls the highly magical [[Pre-Aeolus]] nation, plunging it into a dark age without magic in an otherwise magical world. The [[Anti-Magic Weapon]] is a magical invention derived from [[Dark Aura]], and its magic annihilating/consuming effect is propagated along the towers that form a magical power delivery network in the nation. The [[Dark Aura]] refers to the magic of the [[First Primordial]], as well as to the malignant effects experienced by someone who is infected or corrupted by it. The results of the [[Great Disaster]] are that the entire nation is destroyed in an instant, all magical people in the disaster are basically vaporized, the surrounding landscape is made intrinsically inhospitable to the existence of magic due to some kind of anti-magic fallout, and the generations of people who survive the event are all non-magical, for many generations afterward.

At its core none of these elements are particularly unique. They are inspired by both real life events and by other works of fiction. What is unique is this particular *arrangement* of concepts which would not be applicable to another setting. The nature of the event is closely linked to the function of the [[Pre-Aeolus]] nation’s network, and the results go on to shape the nature of [[Aeolus]] as a nation afterwards in ways I do not think are common. I believed that this arrangement of elements is unique and I maintain that they are a creation of mine alone.
### The [[Herald of Entropy]]
This character at one time had a *very tenuous* link to the [[DDC]] character once called Chernabog, but even that link was gone and replaced with my own ideas prior to the split. Chernabog itself is a character I wish to hold no claim over. This character was initially imagined as a lieutenant of the main villain, who was at the time Chernabog, but as I developed the character and motivation for the [[Herald of Entropy]] I realized that it made far more sense for the [[First Primordial]] to fill that role. As he is now, he holds no connection to any other shared ideas beyond [[Dark Aura]], which itself is explained above.
### The [[Creation of the Star System]] and [[The Age of Primordials]]
The creation myth *as it is described in [[The Age of Primordials]]* is mine. I wrote [[The Age of Primordials]] myself, without critique or advice, and then presented it virtually finished to the group. The creation myth and the description of the star system are built on my idea to have a space warping black hole in the sky, my preference for the spirituality and magic to be "physics first," and the general idea of "[[Great Spirit]]s" existing in the world. As it turns out, this version of creation doesn't fit the world of [[DDC]] anyway, and is a large reason for my decision to branch off my work into its own project. To my understanding, the power that the [[Great Spirit]]s and Aspects in [[DDC]] have come from people's belief in them. This is completely backwards from my interpretation where physics itself is what gives rise to the [[Great Spirit]]s and Aspects, who then create the world and provide magic for mortals to use, and so on. They are fundamentally different concepts, and I am keeping the version I came up with.
### [[Veritas Inventa]]
This is a buisness run by [[Aster Kenos]]. It was originally located in Sev'reon, but really it can be placed in any suitably magically advanced city, so long as it isn't [[Aeolus]]. This buisness, like the character who runs it, is a creation purely of my own.
