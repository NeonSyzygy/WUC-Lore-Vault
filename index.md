# Origin of Ideas & Acknowledgements
The characters, narrative, world, mechanics, and ideas presented here are one step in a long history of collaborative and constantly changing storytelling that I'm grateful to have been a part of. I was invited into a shared fictional world, and in addition to adapting my own prior writings to fit into that narrative I also contributed new ideas to flesh out the world and its mechanics. As time went on and the world evolved to meet the needs of my friends, it started to diverge from the image I had built for myself in my head. I love that shared world, but I also love the ideas and systems I invented that no longer fit into that world, and so I have decided to isolate them and build on them here where they can exist without compromise.
