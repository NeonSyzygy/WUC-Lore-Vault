Using [[Magic]] is an active process, but the methods that [[Mage]]s use can be varied. The only requirement to use [[Magic]] is to channel [[Aura]] through a medium, and in virtually all cases the movement of [[Aura]] is a mental process. It should be possible for a [[Mage]] to produce a [[Magic]]al effect simply by thinking and visualizing, but it is frequently easier when combined with additional physical components.
