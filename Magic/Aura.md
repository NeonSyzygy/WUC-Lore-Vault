[[Aura]] is the fundamental energy used to create [[Magic]]al effects ([Ref](https://discord.com/channels/1206338624334078062/1354565333309984788/1355663248082473142)). It is produced in relatively small quantities by all beings, and those beings shed excess [[Aura]] that they don’t use into their environment.

The amount of [[Aura]] that a single being produces (with the possible exception of the most powerful [[Primordial]]s) is virtually never enough energy to generate any [[Magic]]al effects that would be appreciable to them. Instead, [[Mage]]s and other [[Magic]]ally inclined beings siphon and channel [[Aura]] from the environment through themselves in order to do [[Magic]] at a scale that would be useful to them.

In addition to allowing [[Aura]] to collect and permeate throughout the environment, it can also be collected and stored for later use in [[Aura Reserve]]s. The process of channeling [[Aura]] stored this way is not appreciably different from drawing it from your immediate surroundings, other than you can guarantee you actually *have* a high density of [[Aura]] at your disposal.
