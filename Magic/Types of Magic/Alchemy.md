[[Alchemy]] is the [[Magic]]al process of transmuting something into something else by changing its physical/metaphysical properties. In order to transmute physical matter or concepts, a [[Mage]] must have a thorough comprehension of the thing being transmuted, as well as what it's being transmuted into. For example, a [[Mage]] must fully comprehend the atomic or molecular makeup, as well as the flow and balance of energy, within both lead and gold in order to transmute one into the other.
