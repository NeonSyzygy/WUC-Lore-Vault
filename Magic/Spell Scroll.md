In the same way that [[Magic]] can be permanently imbued into an object, it can be inscribed using cheaper and less substantial materials to create one or limited time use items. [[Spell Scroll]]s or Spell Scribing are one of the more common ways to accomplish this due to the relatively low cost and portable form factor.

A basic [[Spell Scroll]] is scribed with a [[Crystal Powder Ink Suspension]] ([Ref](https://discord.com/channels/1206338624334078062/1206340886083149845/1297299339466510488)), which carries the structure of the magic. The latent [[Magic]] can then be kickstarted with [[Aura]] from the user, and the [[Magic]] is released. As the [[Magic]] flows through the material it damages it ([Ref](https://discord.com/channels/1206338624334078062/1206340886083149845/1297300202142568448)), and usually destroys the [[Spell Scroll]] in the process.
